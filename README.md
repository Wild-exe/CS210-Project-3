# CS-210 Project 3
Project 3 is an item tracker implementing Python functions within a C++ terminal program. The program will read the input text file, then display the quantity of each item in the list, search for a specific item, or display a histogram. With the histogram, the program will also write to frequency.dat. The best feature of this project is the modular user interface. If I were to continue working on this project, I would like to separate the read function and add a function to choose the input file name and output file name to allow for multiple file handling. The only challenge was getting Visual Studio to integrate the Python files. After a clean install of visual studio and utilizing the visual studio python workload, everything worked as expected. This project has been beneficial in allowing me the opportunity to create separate classes for the user interface and core methods. The in-line comments and class, object, and variable names should effectively communicate all information regarding the project for maintainability and readability.
